# MotorCortexTargetPredictionNN
MATLAB script reads in firing rates of 10 neurons in motor cortex during 3 different movement phases as the hand moves a joystick towards a particular target and predicts what target is being approached by building a simple neural network. Varying learning rate and training/testing percentage to see how it affects accuracy.
